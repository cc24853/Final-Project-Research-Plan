-Thesis

How to write a linux driver

-Background on writing Linux drivers

Already started, making slow progress. Aside form that, nothing at all.

-Assumptions

This is gonna be difficult, but since as long as I try and make progress, should be fine.

-Milestones

1. Is this possible?
2. Collecting information about the flavor of linux to be used, type of mouse and other side software.
3. Find basic information about writing a driver, some ways to create a mouse driver in particular and required information to
make linux play nice with the new mouse driver.
4. Test and troublshoot driver until it has basic functionality including detecting movement and clicks.
5. Document everything learned to github, successful or not and conclude project.

-Difficulty

High

-Security Issues

I cannot imagine anything really being a breach in security with this.

-Hardware required

A mouse that does not like linux.
A computer capable of reading mouse drivers and sufficent hardware to run vanilla ubuntu.

-Software required

linux OS of some flavor, using ubuntu current version.
Device to write driver to the mouse
